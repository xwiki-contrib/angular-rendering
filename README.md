Combine AngularJS and XWiki Rendering to display a live rendering preview

To install:
* Build using Maven (mvn clean install). That will give you a WAR in target/
* Copy this WAR to your favorite Servlet container (Tomcat for example, in webapps/) and rename it to xwiki.WAR (so that the context path is "xwiki")
* Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/xwiki/
* Start typing!
